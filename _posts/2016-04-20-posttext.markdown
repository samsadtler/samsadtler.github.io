		PostTexts are a way to make text message fun and exciting again by enabling deeper connection through a physical object. Capturing the tactile feel of the journey through the postal service and bringing us closer through the human quality in our handwriting and the nostalgia of anticipated connection.

		PostTexts, a post card which gives pause to the act of writing text messages by creating a means to share a long conversation with a friend in a familiar format.

		Designed to be sent back and forth* in the mail as a letter that multiple people can enjoy, even the postman!
