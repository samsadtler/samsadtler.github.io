<h2>Augmented Reality Narrative Story Game which interacts with the environment round the players</h2>
<p>
	My contributions involve programming bluetooth communication between the Tango tablet and the arduino driven bluetooth receiver which controls the in room lights.

	In collaboration with Clara Fernandez-Vara, Kaho Abe, Rosanne Limoncelli, Mark Skwarek, and Eddy Melcer.
