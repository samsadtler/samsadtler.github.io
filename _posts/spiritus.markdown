<h2>Augmented Reality Narrative Story Game which interacts with the environment round the players</h2>
<p>
	My contributions involve integrating Bluetooth communication between the Android tablet, Unity and the Arduino driven receiver which controls the in room lights. As well as the development. 

	<h3>Abstract:</h3>
	Spiritus Chronomatix is an exploration using next-gen AR technologies to enable interesting story authoring and story experiences, blurring the lines between physical and virtual worlds and exploring a combination of both screen-based and gestural interactions.

	This project was enabled through the combined talents of a team across Tisch School of Arts and The Tandon School of Engineering have created a prototype about the 721 building as a historic site, offering players the chance to use the Tango device cooperatively to interact with the spirit world. Players will travel through time to aid restless spirits trapped within our building walls.

	Spiritus Chronomatix uses the Google Tango in combination with a Bluetooth enabled Arduino Micro controllers to mock up a story game. These technologies enable a physically explorable space which dynamically reacts to the in game narrative as plays progress. The experience also requires teamwork from participants as the main game controller can only be used if both participants hold onto it throughout the story. If one person lets go they will be trapped in time and space forever!

	In collaboration with Clara Fernandez-Vara, Kaho Abe, Rosanne Limoncelli, Mark Skwarek, and Eddy Melcer.
