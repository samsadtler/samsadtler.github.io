<p> A custom designed assistive tech mat which was designed in collaboration with Emma Petkofsky, Ysolde Stienon, and Katherine Dimitropoulou  to allow Ysolde to develop movement</p>

<p> Core technologies include a Makey Makey, a custom made mat with conductive pads for capacitive touch of objects and web audio interface which accepted keyboard input. </p>

<b>Device Name:</b>

Developing Assistive Touch "DAT" Mat

<b>Primary Population the Device is Being Developed for: </b>Girls with Rett Syndrome

<b>Purpose of the Device: </b>Increase speed of feedback from touch tasks to foster intrinsic motivation and help improve motor planning skills and functional hand use in girls with Rett Syndrome.

<b>Description/Materials: </b>The Developing Assistive Touch (DAT) Mat uses conductive fabric to provide an interactive surface on which capacitive objects can be placed (ie: bananas, forks, spoons, hands, metals objects, and really anything moist). The DAT Mat is then connected to the Makey Makey which is in turn plugged into a computer. When a users touches an object on the DAT Mat it triggers a key that creates a sounds (website depending) on a webpage. Providing the user with immediate feedback for her action.

<b>Literature Review:</b>

Ysolde's occupational therapist, Katherine Dimitropoulou, explained to us that she had previously worked with another women with Rett syndrome and after the woman gained more functional hand use, many other cognitive skills improved. Based on this insight we looked into research that has been done on improving hand use in girls with Rett syndrome. There was unfortunately not a lot of research on the topic, but we were able to find some support for our project.

Downs, J., Parkinson, S., Ranelli, S., Leonard, H., Diener, P. &amp; Lotan, M. (2014). Perspectives on hand function in girls and women with Rett syndrome. <i>Developmental Neurorehabilitation, 17</i>(3): 210-217.

--There is little research on facilitating hand function in girls with Rett syndrome, but the researchers emphasized a focus on motor learning theories and environmental enrichment. We are hoping that by using the Makey Makey and enriching the environment, during actual practical reaching tasks will help generalize hand use skills to everyday life.

--The researchers focused on hand use in this study and found that, "Voluntary hand use was observed when girls were relaxed and strongly motivated, particularly during musical interactions". Using the Makey Makey will allow us to tie music to the task directly.

Sugiyama, Y., Yasuhara, A. (2001). Music therapy for children with rett syndrome. <em>Brain and Development, 23(1): S82-S84. </em>

--The researchers implemented a music therapy protocol and focused on hand use in their intervention. One measure they tested was grasp frequency which is related to volition They found that it increased from 3 to 41 times by the end of the protocol. While this study only looked at 3 individual cases, and the children were much younger (4, 5 and 6 years old), it shows promise for a link between music and volitional hand use.

<b>User Trials:</b>

<strong>First Meeting: 10/2/15</strong>

Met Ysolde, Constance, Katherine, Teachers, and Speech pathologist

Introduced to assistive technologies in Ysolde's life such as Eye Gaze and discussed potential projects. Which included:
<ul>
	<li>Chrome Extension for increased email access by increasing icon size</li>
	<li>Work on improving scrolling using the Eye Gaze</li>
	<li>Eye Gaze development for decreasing steps to access folders</li>
	<li>Use Makey Makey or similar device which helps Ysolde work on functional hand use</li>
</ul>
Based on the discussions during our home visit and skills of our team, we decided to focus on using the Makey Makey to make interactive experiences related to hand use.

<strong>Makey Makey Prototype: 10/9/15</strong>

Sam created a Makey Makey prototype using an Arduino. We connected metal utensils and conductive fabric to test it out. At the bottom of the table we placed a copper strip to close the circuit. With one hand on the copper wire and one hand on one of the utensils or fabric, the user would activate a key that was connected to an online piano. Closing the circuit would create a piano noise. We were able to get a Makey Makey the next week to bring to our first user trial.

<strong>User Test 1  with Ysolde, Katherine, and Constance: 10/16/15</strong>

Once we had a Makey Makey, we brought it over to Ysolde's house to see how she liked it. This also helped us identify what we could do the enhance the experience of the Makey Makey. We connected the Makey Makey to clay because it was something Ysolde had easily available and we knew it would be conductive. We grounded the Makey Makey with a cuff made of tin foil wrapped around Ysolde's wrist.

Ysolde did not like the cuff around her wrist that we used to ground the connected. Based on this we decided to make a mat for her feet. This way she would just have to keep her feet on the mat in order to ground the connection, and she wouldn't have to have a wire connected to her arm.

We decided that we wanted a way to avoid having wires coming directly from the objects themselves. This is how we decided to try a mat. The mat would allow objects to be placed on conductive patches and the wires to the Makey Makey would connect to the patch rather than the object.

We learned that a continuous noise while the key was being pressed was better then one quick noise when the key is initially pressed. We used a drum program offered by Makey Makey for the trial. Ysolde prefers piano music, so we tried to find a program that would connect to a piano with a continuous sound while a key is pressed.

Finally, we noticed that the clay was not a very motivating or practical everyday use type of item. We wanted to be sure our final product would be able to incorporate objects that Ysolde actually needs to use on a daily basis. At the end of the session we tried connecting the Makey Makey to a tortilla chip. Ysolde reached out for the chip and was surprised to hear it make a noise. This emphasized the importance of making the object meaningful, along with enhancing the environment.

<strong>Prototype 2: DAT Mat</strong>

The image on the left is our first prototype of the "DAT" mat. We used scraps of  ripstop conductive fabric to make the pads and plain cotton as the base of the mat. We use conductive ribbon to add distance between the pads and where the wires for the Makey Makey connect.

We also made a foot mat using the same materials. Because we used scraps of ripstop conductive fabric, we tried place them in a way that would cover as much surface area as possible with the material we had.

<strong>User Test 2 with Ysolde and Katherine: 11/14/15</strong>

Our second user test with Ysolde was in her kitchen with Katherine. We have the opportunity to try out the mat which has conductive fabric, so conductive objects can be placed on it. We also created a foot mat which serves to ground Ysolde while she is using the mat. This was a big improvement over the aluminium foil cuff because it allows her to wear her socks and there is nothing physically tethering her to the table.

<strong>Movement Study:</strong>
<div>video</div>

During the playtest night, we were unable to have Ysolde come to NYU and we had lent our most recent prototype to her during our last visit. So we made a simple board which explored user's range of movement as they played various games using oversize arrow keys.

<strong>Final Prototype:</strong>
