	Skinner's Scanner is an interactive video projection installation which follows the day in the life of the scanner as it is used and abused at an elementary school. 

	Users can walk up to the scanner and by lifting its lid can peer into the world from its point of view. 

	This piece was shown in the 2016 xStory Showcase at NYU.

	Skinner's Scanner was done in collaboration with <a href="oryano.com"> Oryan Inbar </a>, and <a href="http://www.thearae.com/">Thea Rae</a>. Acting was done by Rocky
