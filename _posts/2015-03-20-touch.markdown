This wearable device was designed to allow the wearer to be provided with an additional sense as the browse on their computer. Our memories are directly connected to our senses, yet our digital lives are almost entire visually based in the same 2D format. In order to promote the use of other senses I designed a bracelet which can be used to feel the texture of webpages as a way to provide new context about their content.
