Sam Sadtler is currently a second year Masters Candidate at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU. Specializing in Web Development, Connected devices (IoT), Design, Wearables, and Bike riding.

Sam grew up in Concord, MA and studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Rochester in New York. He has always been passionate about the intersection of art and science. After completing a B.S. he was awarded a tuition free fifth year to study photography and media studies. His art work focused on questioning the sustainability of western society’s attitude towards the consumption of electronics. Using appliances as his medium he created photos, videos, and installation pieces.
 
His work focused on technologies at the brink of obsolescence that are desperately trying to convince us of their relevance and, if nothing else, to get our attention just long enough to say goodbye. Sam’s stunningly beautiful series of photographs teaches us about the beauty of the technology itself, its falsely accelerated shelf-life, and the consumer culture that pressures us to continuously buy the same technological object just because it is wrapped in a different package.
