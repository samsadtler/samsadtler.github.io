				I am currently the Lead Software Developer at a startup called <a
					href="https://touchcode.com/">Touchcode</a>
				working
				with web development and printed mobile engagement technology. Tasked with
				creating all types of customer experiences from quick sales demos to dashboards, I
				learned to be flexible in my approach to solving problems.
			</p>

			<p>
				The demos built with Gulp, Babel, and Bootstrap and deployed on Azure,
				<a herf="https://try.tc/demo/"> try.tc </a>utilized CSS animations which promote
				a seamless connection from the physical to the digital. I have also
				worked to develop a secure analytics dashboards built in React and Redux which
				showcases engagement data for our customers in meaningful ways. Having to both
				manage a remote development team while engaging the sale and marketing teams
				to meet customer requirements, I am continually developing strong communication
				skills which focus on distilling actionable items.
			</p>
			<p>
				While not at work, I try to make novel experiences with new and dated
				technologies which call attention to our relationships to these often cold objects. I
				recently utilized an Amazon Alexa and a Google Home, to created an installation
				during my <a href="https://pioneerworks.org/residency/sam-sadtler/"> Pioneer Works Tech Residency</a>.
				The two A.I.s interacted with each other through custom made skills which focused on existential
				questions. They were installed at Pioneer Works for Second Sunday. Another example is, during my time at
				NYU's <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp">Interactive Telecommunications Program</a> I developed an iOS
				app
				called <a href="/shakie">Shakie </a> designed to bring the joy back to taking selfies.
